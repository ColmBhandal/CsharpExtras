# How to contribute to CsharpExtras

## **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/ColmBhandal/CsharpExtras/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/ColmBhandal/CsharpExtras/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=). Note the new issue should follow the "Bug Report" issue template in this case.

## **Do you Want to Contribute Code to the Repo?**

* Before writing any code, please ensure that you have been assigned an issue and it has been approved by the team.

* To request assignment of an existing issue, comment on the issue and await assignment by the team. 

* If you opened the issue yourself, then await approval by the project team prior to beginning work on it 

* Note: code implementing functionality that is not related to an approved issue may not be accepted. 

* Once you have been assigned an issue, you can contribute your code via a pull request (PR). 

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. LInk the PR to the issue(s) that it solves e.g. by including the relevant issue number(s) in the PR description.

## **Do you have an Idea for a New Feature or an Improvement to an Existing one?**

* [Open a new issue](https://github.com/ColmBhandal/CsharpExtras/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md&title=) on GitHub following the "Feature Request" template.

## **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* [Open a new issue](https://github.com/ColmBhandal/CsharpExtras/issues/new), type in your question and label it as "Question".

## Pull Request Guidelines

**IMPORTANT: Please do not create a Pull Request that is not linked to an issue.**

* The PR must solve one or more existing issues.

* Ensure any issues that this PR solves are linked to the PR.

* If you created any of those issues yourself, please ensure that a member of the project team has approved the issue before working on it. Approval will guarantee that the issue is sufficiently well written and that it constitutes an appropriate change.

## C# Coding Conventions

Code contributions should adhere to the coding conventions defined in the project [wiki](https://github.com/ColmBhandal/CsharpExtras/wiki/Coding-Conventions). We recommend you read them before you start working on something to reduce the chance of your pull request requiring changes.
