## **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

## **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* [Open a new issue](https://github.com/ColmBhandal/CsharpExtras/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md&title=) on GitHub following the "Feature Request" template.

## Pull Request Guidelines

**IMPORTANT: Please do not create a Pull Request that is not linked to an issue.**

* The PR must solve one or more existing issues.

* Ensure any issues that this PR solves are linked to the PR.

* If you created any of those issues yourself, please ensure that a member of the project team has approved the issue before working on it. Approval will guarantee that the issue is sufficiently well written and that it constitutes an appropriate change.
